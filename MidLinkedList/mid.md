# Find the Midpoint of a Linked List

## Interviewer: Stephen Clemmer

## Input

- Input: Linked List: 1->3->4->5->6->9->10

## Output

- return midpoint: 5

## Test Cases

- Can we assume that this linked list only contains integers
- Can we assume that this is a finite linked list
- Is the output looking for the number of the node in the linked list or the value?
- Stretch test case: what if there is an even amount of nodes within the linked list?

## Feedback

- Do not only think of while loops, find the length using the first loop which is a while loop, then finding the value using the for loop. Remember that the while loop is for an unknown length, and for loop is for a length that is already known.
